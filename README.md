# Just a little openweathermap forecast tool

This little tool shows forecast for local city.

Please, get your own key on openweathermap site to get access to their API. Just rename `example.some.js` to `some.js` and put your API key into it.

Note that city at this moment is set to RIga, Latvia. You need to change it to your own.
